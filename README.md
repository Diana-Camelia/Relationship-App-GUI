In the column “Username” is displayed all the users registered on the platform.  
In the column “Friends” you can see all of your friends.
In the column “Requests” is shown all the received friend requests.

•	If you select a user from the column “Username” you can send a friend request to the selected person just by pressing the button “Add friend”. If the action is finished successfully, a corresponding message will be displayed, else, if you miss to select a user, a corresponding message will be displayed too.
